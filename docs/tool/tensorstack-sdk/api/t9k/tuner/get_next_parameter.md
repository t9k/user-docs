# t9k.tuner.get_next_parameter

```python
get_next_parameter()
```

Gets the hyper paremeters generated by tuner. For a multiphase experiment, it returns a new group of hyper parameters at each call of get_next_parameter. For a non-multiphase (multiPhase is not configured or set to False) experiment, it returns hyper parameters only on the first call for each trial job, it returns None since second call. This API should be called only once in each trial job of an experiment which is not specified as multiphase.

## Returns

A dict object contains the hyper parameters generated by tuner, the keys of the dict are defined in
search space. Returns None if no more hyper parameters can be generated by tuner.
