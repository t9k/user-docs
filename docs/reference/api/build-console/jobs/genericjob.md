_Appears in:_
- [GenericJobStatus](#genericjobstatus)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `creating` _integer_ | Pod has been created, but resources have not been scheduled. |
| `pending` _integer_ | Pod has been accepted by the system, but one or more of the containers has not been started. This includes time before being bound to a node, as well as time spent pulling images onto the host. |
| `running` _integer_ | Pod has been bound to a node and all of the containers have been started. At least one container is still running or is in the process of being restarted. |
| `succeeded` _integer_ | All containers in the pod have voluntarily terminated with a container exit code of 0, and the system is not going to restart any of these containers. |
| `failed` _integer_ | All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure (exited with a non-zero exit code or was stopped by the system). |
| `unknown` _integer_ | For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod. |
| `deleted` _integer_ | Pod has been deleted. |


#### CleanUpPolicy

_Underlying type:_ `string`

CleanUpPolicy specifies the collection of replicas that are to be deleted upon job completion.

_Appears in:_
- [GenericJobSpec](#genericjobspec)



#### ContainerStatus



ContainerStatus defines the observed state of the container.

_Appears in:_
- [ReplicaStatus](#replicastatus)



#### DebugMode



DebugMode configs whether and how to start a job in debug mode.

#### GenericJob



GenericJob represents the schema for a general-purpose batch job API. While it offers less automation compared to specialized APIs like PyTorchTrainingJob, it allows for greater flexibility in specifying parallel replicas/pods. This design serves as a comprehensive job definition mechanism when more specialized APIs are not applicable or available.
